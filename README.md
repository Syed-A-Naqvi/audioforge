# Description

The purpose of this project is to obtain granular control over the amount of noise inserted into a sound file. One can specify the desired sound to noise ratio and the appropriate amount of white noise will be inserted into the sound file. Controlled noise insertion allows for testing the effectos of noise on audio in various settings.

# Instructions

- clone repo and run the command ```python3 add_noise.py <audio_file>``` in the terminal
- replace ```<audio_file>``` with the name of the ravdess audio file to normalize and in which to insert noise
- check the output folder for original audio, scaled(normalized) audio and finally the noisy audio
